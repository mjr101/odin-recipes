      <ul>
        <li><strong>1 chicken stock pot</strong></li>
        <li><strong>150g white basmati rice</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 onion</strong>, 1cm dice</li>
        <li><strong>3 tbsp fresh coriander</strong>, roughly chopped</li>
        <li><strong>150g green beans</strong>, trimmed and cut into 3 pieces</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and very finely chopped</li>
        <li><strong>2 skinless chicken breasts</strong>, chopped into 2cm dice</li>
        <li><strong>3 tbsp flaked almonds</strong></li>
        <li><strong>flavourless oil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 &frac12; tsp curry powder</strong></li>
        <li><strong>4 tbsp mango chutney</strong></li>
        <li><strong>50g raisins</strong></li>
        <li><strong>150ml double cream</strong></li>
        <li><strong>salt and black pepper</strong></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>
        Steps
      </h2>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Put a pan of 330ml water over a high heat and bring to the boil. Stir in half the <strong>chicken stock pot</strong> until it dissolves, then add the <strong>rice</strong>. Stir and return to the boil, pop a lid on the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 mins. When the 10 mins are up, remove the pan from the heat and leave to the side for another 10 mins. For perfectly cooked <strong>rice</strong> don't touch the lid until 20 mins are up.</li>
      
        <li>Prep the <strong>onion</strong>, <strong>coriander</strong>, <strong>green beans</strong>, <strong>ginger</strong> and <strong>chicken</strong>.</li>
      
        <li>Heat a frying pan over a medium-high heat with no oil, add the <strong>flaked almonds</strong> and fry until golden brown. Remove and keep to the side.</li>
      
        <li>Put 1 tbsp <strong>oil</strong> in your (now empty) pan. Add the <strong>onion</strong> and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 5 mins. Add the <strong>chicken</strong>, <strong>ginger</strong> and <strong>curry powder</strong> and cook, stirring, for 1 min to combine. Reduce the heat to medium-low, stir in half the <strong>mango chutney</strong>, the <strong>raisins</strong>, <strong>double cream</strong>, remaining half <strong>chicken stock pot</strong> and 150ml water. Season with &frac14; tsp <strong>salt</strong> and a few grinds of <strong>black pepper</strong>.</li>
      
        <li>Bring the <strong>curry</strong> to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and creamy and the <strong>chicken</strong> is cooked and no longer pink in the middle, 8-10 mins. Halfway through cooking, stir in the <strong>green beans</strong>.</li>
      
        <li>When the <strong>curry</strong> is cooked, stir through half the chopped <strong>coriander</strong>, taste and add more <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>black pepper</strong> if you feel it needs it. If you like things a little sweeter, stir through the remaining <strong>mango chutney</strong> - this is how we like it (if not, you can serve some on the side). Fluff up the <strong>rice</strong> with a fork.</li>
      
        <li>Stir the remaining <strong>coriander</strong> through the <strong>rice</strong> and serve it in bowls topped with plenty of <strong>chicken curry</strong> and a scattering of <strong>flaked almonds</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
