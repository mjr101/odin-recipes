        Steps
      </h2>
  
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven to 220&deg;C/Gas Mark 7</strong>. Put a large pan of water with 1 tbsp <strong>salt</strong> over a high heat and bring to the boil for the <strong>pasta</strong>. Prep the <strong>peppers</strong> and place on a baking tray. Coat evenly with 1 tbsp <strong>olive oil</strong> and season with &frac14; tsp <strong>salt</strong> and a good grind of <strong>black pepper</strong>, then toss together. Cook on the top shelf of your oven for 15 mins.</li>
  
        <li>Prep the <strong>garlic</strong>, <strong>basil</strong>, <strong>red chilli</strong> and <strong>pancetta</strong> (if you've bought whole pancetta). If you're making this on the spur of the moment and don't have <strong>pancetta</strong>, you can use a bit of chopped <strong>smokey bacon</strong> instead.</li>
  
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp <strong>olive oil</strong> in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the <strong>pancetta</strong> until crispy, around 4 mins. Add the <strong>garlic</strong> and <strong>balsamic vinegar</strong>. Cook together for 1 min, the <strong>vinegar</strong> should evaporate. Add the <strong>tomatoes</strong> and the <strong>chilli</strong> (as much as you dare) and season with &frac14; tsp <strong>salt</strong> and a few grinds of <strong>black pepper</strong>. Cook over a medium heat for around 10 mins, until you have a nice thick sauce.</li>
  
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the <strong>penne</strong> in the pan of boiling water for around 11 mins (or according to the packet instructions), until it is 'al dente' (cooked through but with a tiny bit of firmness left in the middle).</li>
  
        <li>Once the <strong>pasta</strong> is cooked, drain it and then stir into the thickened <strong>tomato sauce</strong>. Make sure the <strong>pepper</strong> is nice and soft and add it to the <strong>sauce</strong> too.</li>
  
        <li>Scatter the <strong>basil leaves</strong> over the pasta. Grate on the <strong>Parmesan</strong> and dig in.</li>
  
      </ol>
